# NumLua

NumLua is a high-performance linear algebra library for Lua, implemented in C for maximum performance.

## Data Types

NumLua currently primarily supports `double` data types. While we plan to expand support for various data types in future releases, please be aware that as of now, NumLua does not have full support for different data types.

We are actively working on improving and expanding the capabilities of NumLua, and your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.
